<h2>Course Projects</h2>
	<ul>
				<li><h3>Centre Power Awareness</h3></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Developed a dynamic runtime environment for HPC which would provide trade-off between performance, energy and thermal characteristics of the system with the help of monitoring, analysis and feedback</h4></li>
				</ul>
				<li><h2>Code Optimization for Scalar and Parallel Programs</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Implemented a source-to-source compiler using Cetus to allocate data structures in the correct MCDRAM based on the thread location on Intel KNL architecture for OpenMP programs</h4></li>
				</ul>
				<li><h2>Real-time Operating Systems</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Implemented different scheduling and resource allocation policies with EV3RT kernel and LEGO Mindstorms to operate a line following robot, segaway and obstacle avoiding robot</h4></li>
						<li><h4>Created a client-server based IoT-cloud interaction with Nordic nRF51 board and SDK along with Raspberry Pi</h4></li>
				</ul>
				<li><h2>Compiler Construction</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Implemented the scanner, parser and IR stages of a basic source-to-source compiler for the C language using C</h4></li>
				</ul>
				<li><h2>Parallel Systems</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Created own message passing library for parallel programs using Socket programming in C and optimized it for round-trip timing</h4></li>
						<li><h4>Parallelized and accelerated a serial program for simulating the surface of a lake using CUDA programming, OpenMP, OpenAcc and MPI</h4></li>
						<li><h4>Reduced power consumption of the cluster, by using DVFS to throttle frequency, for NAS Parallel benchmarks</h4></li>
				</ul>
				<li><h2>Operating Systems</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Modified the XINU kernel implementing Process Scheduling Algorithms, Locking Techniques for Reader-Writers Problem, Process-centric Garbage Collection, Buffer cache management and Disk scheduling</h4></li>
