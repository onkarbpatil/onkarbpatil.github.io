				<li><h2>Software Support for Heterogeneous Memories in HPC</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>This project proposes to explore different solutions of software support for heterogeneous memory architectures for future supercomputers. Its primary aim will be to seamlessly integrate the new memory technologies in to the existing architecture support while taking full advantage of its characteristics for existing HPC applications and making the programmers job easier for developing new applications for the future systems.</h4></li>

				<li><h2><a href="patil-th.pdf" >Pico-kernel Adaptive and Scalable Operating Systems Phase II (PICASO2) (Masters Thesis)</a></h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Developed Pico/micro kernels on Intel Single Chip Cloud (SCC) platform for efficient collective and point-to-point communication between cores exploiting the shared memory architecture and exploring different communication patterns using the on-chip mesh</h4></li>

				<li><h2>Parallelized and Distributed Web Crawler (Undergraduate Thesis)</h2></li>
				<ul>
						<li><h4>Designed a Web Crawler for high performance search engines demonstrating the benefits of parallelization of the crawling tasks and distributing(off-loading) the indexing and storing tasks. Developed a Perl Script for efficient data extraction from the HTML webpages and C++ programs for accurate indexing and storing of web pages.</h4></li>
