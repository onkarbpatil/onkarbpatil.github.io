<h3>I am a PhD student from North Carolina State University studying in my 4th year of graduate studies. I am a motivated and passionate individual with a zest for research in High Performance Computing. I aspire to achieve excellence by contributing to my field of interest in every way possible. I wish to work with other aspirants and the stalwarts in Computer Science to gain immense technical expertise and intellect. My current research field is primarily based on Compilers and Heterogeneous Memory architectures. My current work is focused on using static code analysis for automating memory placements in complex memory systems. I have previously worked with power consumption control for HPC systems, Predictable collective communication for on-chip mesh networks and Transactional HPC: a framework for stencil application in memory centric architectures.</h3>
